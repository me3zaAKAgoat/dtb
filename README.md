## Introduction

DTB is a productivity tracking and stress management application designed to alleviate the burdens of planning and remembering tasks during demanding work or study periods. By providing a user-friendly board equipped with numerous features, DTB enables users to organize their responsibilities.

DTB also offers visualized statistics that offer valuable insights into one's mental and emotional well-being. By monitoring performance metrics, users can proactively prevent burnout and optimize their habits.

DTB aims to enhance productivity and maintain the quality of work by empowering users to effectively manage their workload.

DTB embodies many of my ideas for enhancing productivity. It replaces traditional task checkboxes with percentage completion, which rewards even small efforts and keeps you motivated to contribute to your daily aspirations. It assigns priority to each task, recognizing that not all tasks are equal. Every contribution adds up to a total completion percentage for the cycle, providing insight into your overall productivity.

DTB offers a fresh take on productivity that particularly benefits individuals with ADHD who require a more visual and dynamic source of motivation, ensuring that motivation is sustained.

DTB is particularly valuable for students who need to keep track of various aspects of their curriculum.
